## usage

### quick start

to start jupyter lab

```bash
workspace on ÓÇ† master [?] via üêç v3.11.8 (venv) 
‚¨¢ [Docker] ‚ùØ start-jupyter
```

in `notebooks/basic` you can find some notebook tutorials (some of them are out of date!).
**do not modify notebooks in `notebooks/basic` directly, because your modification will be overwriten once you synchronize the local code to the remote repository.**

one way is to create a folder in `notebooks`, for example, `notebooks/my-notebooks`.
besides `notebooks/basic`, any folder in `notebook/` will not be checked during code synchronization.
